/***********************************************************************************************************
 Purpose:      Gets top 14 Key Performance Indicators (KPI).   This is a replacement for various perfmons statistics.  
               DMV's are used which are a lower resource use than perfmon.
               The statistics are collected over a specified interval and returned as a recordset.  This may show up 
               as a long running process on some monitoring systems due to the WAITFOR verb being used.

 Proc Name:    spGetKPI_Top14

 Inputs:       iDelay                     Number of seconds to delay while collecting statistics.

 Outputs:      [Event Date]               Starting Date / Time of the reporting period.
               [SQL Proc Utiliz %]        Percentage of the CPU that SQL is utilizing.
               [CPU Idle %]               Percentage of the CPU that is doing nothing.
               [Other Proc Utiliz %]      Percentage of the CPU used by other processes.
               [User Connections]         The number of users currently connected to the SQL Server. 
               [Logins Per Sec]           The number of logins per second.
               [Logouts Per Sec]          The number of logouts per second.
               [% Page Splits Per Batch]  Number of page splits per second that occur as the result of overflowing index pages. 
               [Buffer Cache Hit Ratio]   Percentage of pages found in the buffer cache without having to read from disk. 
               [Page Life Expectancy]     How long data pages are staying in the buffer. 
               [Latch Waits Per Sec]      Number of latch requests that could not be granted immediately. 
               [Total Latch Wait Time]    Total latch wait time (in milliseconds) for latch requests in the last second
               [Lock Waits Per Sec]       How many users waited to acquire a lock over the past second.  
               [Number of Deadlocks/sec]  The number of lock requests that resulted in a deadlock. 
               [Batch Requests Per sec]   Number of batch requests that SQL Server receives per second. 

 Dependencies: NONE
